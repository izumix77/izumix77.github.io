<p>Hello, I'm <strong>izumix77</strong>. This blog explores the intersection of AI, trading, technology, and philosophy.
</p>

<p>I’m a trader specialized in FX. Most of my trading is automated via EAs (Expert Advisors), so it's pretty hands-off.
</p>

<p>I develop cryptocurrency bots in Python, experimenting with arbitrage strategies and beyond.</p>

<p>This blog is a place where I share thoughts on UX, UI, and the future of AI—from a creator's perspective.</p>
